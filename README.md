# bank_churn
This is a data science project analysis and predicition model calculated based on dataset from kaggle.
For this project, I've been using, Google Collab's IDE and Python's programming language. 
The libraries used for analysis and ETL are Pandas, Seaborn and SciPy. For ML's prediction models, the Scikit learn and XGBoost's libraries were used.
